# PAGES

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.

The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

So basically for example for projects it can be used to create an overview page of all the projects.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
